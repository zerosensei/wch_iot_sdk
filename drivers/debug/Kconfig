      Enable debugging options.

config PRINTK
    bool "Enable printk() fuction"
    default y
    help
      This option enables the printk() to be sent out.

config ASSERT
	bool "__ASSERT() macro"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
      This enables the __ASSERT() macro in the code. If an assertion fails, 
      the policy for what to do is controlled by the implementation of the 
      assert_post_action() function.

	help
      This option specifies the assertion level used by the __ASSERT()
	  macro. It can be set to one of three possible values:

	  Level 0: off
	  Level 1: on + warning in every file that includes __assert.h
	  Level 2: on + no warning
      	
endif # ASSERT

config FORCE_NO_ASSERT
	bool "Force-disable no assertions"
	help
	  This boolean option disables assertion testing even
	  in circumstances (twister) where it is enabled via
	  CFLAGS and not Kconfig.  Added solely to be able to work
	  around compiler bugs for specific tests.

config ASSERT_VERBOSE
	bool "Verbose assertions"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables printing an assert message with information about
	  the assertion that occurred. This includes printing the location,
	  the conditional expression and additional message specific to the
	  assert.

config ASSERT_NO_FILE_INFO
	bool "Disable file info for asserts"
	help
	  This option removes the name and the path of the source file
	  in which the assertion occurred. Enabling this will save
	  target code space, and thus may be necessary for tiny targets.

config ASSERT_NO_COND_INFO
	bool "Disable condition info for asserts"
	help
	  This option removes the assert condition from the printed assert
	  message. Enabling this will save target code space, and thus may be
	  necessary for tiny targets. It is recommended to disable condition
	  info before disabling file info since the condition can be found in
	  the source using file info.

config ASSERT_NO_MSG_INFO
	bool "Disable message for asserts"
	help
	  This option removes the additional message from the printed assert.
	  Enabling this will save target code space, and thus may be
	  necessary for tiny targets. It is recommended to disable message
	  before disabling file info since the message can be found in the
	  source using file info.
