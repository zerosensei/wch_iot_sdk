config CODING_GUIDELINE_CHECK
	bool "Enforce coding guideline rules"
	help
	  Use available compiler flags to check coding guideline rules during
	  the build.

choice COMPILER_OPTIMIZATIONS
	prompt "Optimization level"
	default SIZE_OPTIMIZATIONS
	help
	  Note that these flags shall only control the compiler
	  optimization level, and that no extra debug code shall be
	  conditionally compiled based on them.

config SIZE_OPTIMIZATIONS
	bool "Optimize for size"
	help
	  Compiler optimizations will be set to -Os independently of other
	  options.

config SPEED_OPTIMIZATIONS
	bool "Optimize for speed"
	help
	  Compiler optimizations will be set to -O2 independently of other
	  options.

config DEBUG_OPTIMIZATIONS
	bool "Optimize debugging experience"
	help
	  Compiler optimizations will be set to -Og independently of other

config COMPILER_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS
	bool "Colored diagnostics"
	default y
	help
	  Compiler diagnostic messages are colorized.

config COMPILER_OPT
	string "Custom compiler options"
	help
	  This option is a free-form string that is passed to the compiler
	  when building all parts of a project (i.e. kernel).
	  The compiler options specified by this string supplement the
	  predefined set of compiler supplied by the build system,
	  and can be used to change compiler optimization, warning and error
	  messages, and so on.

config KERNEL_BIN_NAME
	string "The kernel binary name"
	default "wch"
	help
	  This option sets the name of the generated kernel binary.

config OUTPUT_STAT
	bool "Create a statistics file"
	default y
	help
	  Create a stat file using readelf -e <elf>

config OUTPUT_SYMBOLS
	bool "Create a symbol file"

	depends on OUTPUT_DISASSEMBLY
	help
	  The .lst file will contain complete disassembly of the firmware
	  not just those expected to contain instructions including zeros

config OUTPUT_PRINT_MEMORY_USAGE
	bool "Print memory usage to stdout"
	default y
	help
	  If the toolchain supports it, this option will pass
	  --print-memory-region to the linker when it is doing it's first
	  linker pass. Note that the memory regions are symbolic concepts
	  defined by the linker scripts and do not necessarily map
	  directly to the real physical address space. Take also note that
	  some platforms do two passes of the linker so the results do not
	  match exactly to the final elf file. See also rom_report,
	  ram_report and
	  https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/MEMORY.html
